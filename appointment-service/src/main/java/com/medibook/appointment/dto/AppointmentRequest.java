/*
 * This is the DTO for creating an appointment.
 *
 * Think of it like the booking form a patient fills
 * when they want to see a doctor.
 * Patient selects doctor, slot, date, time,
 * type of service, and how they want to consult.
 *
 * Why a DTO and not directly the Appointment entity?
 * We never expose database entities to outside world.
 * DTO carries only what patient needs to send.
 * Server side fields like status, createdAt are
 * set internally — patient should not control those.
