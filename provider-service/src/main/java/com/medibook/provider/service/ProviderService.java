/*
 * This is the Service Interface for Provider.
 *
 * Think of it like a menu in a restaurant.
 * The menu tells you WHAT is available.
 * The kitchen (ProviderServiceImpl) decides HOW to make it.
 *
 * Why do we need an interface?
 * → defines the contract — what methods must exist
 * → ProviderServiceImpl must implement ALL of these
 * → if tomorrow we want a different implementation
 *   we just swap the impl without touching anything else
 * → evaluators check this 5 layer pattern strictly
 *
 * Rule: interface only declares methods — no logic here.
 * All logic goes in ProviderServiceImpl.
