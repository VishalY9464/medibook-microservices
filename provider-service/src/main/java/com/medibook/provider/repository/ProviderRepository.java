 * This is the Repository for Provider entity.

 * Think of it like a helper that knows how to talk to the database.
 * We define what queries we need here and Spring Data JPA
 * automatically writes the SQL for us behind the scenes.
 *
 * We never write SQL manually — Spring figures it out
 * from the method names we write here.
 *
 * Example:
 * findBySpecialization("Cardiologist")
 * Spring converts this to:
 * SELECT * FROM providers WHERE specialization = 'Cardiologist'

//**Why each method exists:**
//findByUserId()
//→ doctor logs in → we find their profile
//→ also checks if profile already exists before creating new one
//
//findBySpecialization()  
//→ patient selects "Cardiologist" from dropdown  
//→ we return all cardiologists
//
//findByIsVerified()
//→ admin wants to see all pending verifications 
//→ patient search only shows verified doctors
//
//searchByNameOrSpecialization()
//→ search bar on patient dashboard
//→ custom @Query needed because name is in users table
//→ LOWER() makes it case insensitive
//
//findByIsVerifiedAndIsAvailable()
//→ most important query for patient search
//→ both conditions must be true
//→ verified by admin AND currently available
