/*
 * This is the Service Interface for Payment.
 *
 * Think of it like the rules book for the accounts department.
 * It defines WHAT payment operations are possible.
 * PaymentServiceImpl defines HOW each operation works.
 *
 * Why interface first?
 * → Defines contract before writing logic
 * → PaymentResource depends on this interface not implementation
 * → When we swap mock → Razorpay:
 *   we only change PaymentServiceImpl
 *   this interface stays EXACTLY the same
 *   PaymentResource stays EXACTLY the same
 *   Zero breaking changes anywhere
 *
 * This is the key to our Razorpay-ready architecture.
 * Interface = stable contract
 * Impl = swappable logic
