/*
 * This is the REST Controller for Payment.
 *
 * Think of it like the payment counter at a hospital.
 * Patient walks up to counter (sends HTTP request).
 * Counter staff (this controller) takes the request.
 * Passes it to accounts department (PaymentService).
 * Returns receipt back to patient.
 *
 * No business logic here — just receive and respond.
 * All logic lives in PaymentServiceImpl.
 *
 * No gateway code here — completely gateway agnostic.
 * Whether mock or Razorpay runs behind the scenes,
 * this controller does not know and does not care.
 *
 * @RestController → handles REST API requests
 * @RequestMapping → all URLs start with /payments
