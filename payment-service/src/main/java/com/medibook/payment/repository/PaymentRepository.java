/*
 * This is the Repository for Payment entity.
 *
 * Think of it like the accounts department of a hospital.
 * We ask questions like:
 * "Show me all payments for patient Rahul"
 * "Has appointment #5 been paid for?"
 * "What is the total revenue this month?"
 * "Show me all failed payments"
 *
 * Spring Data JPA writes SQL automatically
 * from method names we define here.
 *
 * RAZORPAY READY:
 * findByRazorpayPaymentId() is already here.
 * When Razorpay integrated → used to find payment
 * during webhook verification.
 * findByRazorpayOrderId() used to match order
 * when Razorpay sends payment confirmation.
 * Zero changes needed to this file when we swap.
